In this lab, you will:

1. Setup ``git``
2. Create a private homework repository on Github
3. Revisit HW 1, Exercise 17

## Setup ``git``

You will be using ``git`` to submit **every lab assignment for grading**.

``git`` is an extremely powerful version control system widely used in the
open source scientific computing community.  Rather than trying to learn
everything that you can about ``git`` right away, you will only be learning
the things you need to immediately use.  Over the next several weeks, you
will incrementally learn how to use more of its features.

Entering ``git`` at a shell prompt, will produce output something like
this (try this on your own computer):

```bash
$ git
usage: git <command> [<args>]

The most commonly used git commands are:
   add        Add file contents to the index
   config     Get and set repository or global options
   clone      Clone a repository into a new directory   
   commit     Record changes to the repository
   log        Show commit logs
   push       Update remote refs along with associated objects
   status     Show the working tree status

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' lists available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
```

When you try this on your computer, you will see much more information.
I've reduced the output so that it only contains information relevant
for today's lab.

The first thing you need to do is configure ``git``:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Jarrod Millman"
git config --global user.email "millman@berkeley.edu"
```

## Create a private homework repository on Github

Make sure you are logged onto Github.  In your user bar at the top right
of any Github page, click the ["Create a New Repo"](https://github.com/new)
button.

1. Name your repository "stat133"
2. Make sure it is private
3. Select "Initialize this repository with a README"
4. Choose "Python" in the pull-down menu to add a .gitignore file

Your screen should look like this (except ``jarrodmillman`` will
be replaced by your Github name):

![Create New Github Repo]({filename}/images/github_new_repo.png)

Once you click the "Create repository" button, you should see a
page like this:

![Your New Repo]({filename}/images/github_s133_repo.png)

In order for me to see (and grade) your private repository, you will
need to add me as a colloborator.  In the lower right-hand corner of
your repositories main page, you should see a button labelled
"Settings".  Click on the "Settings" button will take you to
a page where you can edit various settings for your repository.
Choose the "Collaborators" button on the "Settings" page and
add me, ``jarrodmillman``.

![Github Add Collaborator]({filename}/images/github_add_collab.png)

### Clone repository to your local machine

```bash
cd            # go to your home directory
mkdir src     # make a source subdirectory 
git clone https://github.com/<your github name goes here>/stat133.git
```

## Revisit HW 1, Exercise 17

Exercise 17 in Learn Python The Hard Way provides the
following script:

```python
from sys import argv
from os.path import exists

script, from_file, to_file = argv

print "Copying from %s to %s" % (from_file, to_file)

# we could do these two on one line too, how?
in_file = open(from_file)
indata = in_file.read()

print "The input file is %d bytes long" % len(indata)

print "Does the output file exist? %r" % exists(to_file)
print "Ready, hit RETURN to continue, CTRL-C to abort."
raw_input()

out_file = open(to_file, 'w')
out_file.write(indata)

print "Alright, all done."

out_file.close()
in_file.close() 
```
