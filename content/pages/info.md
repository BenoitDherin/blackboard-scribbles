## Instructor
Benoit Dherin

## Prerequisites
Familiarity with basic concepts in probability and statistics is important.
Being comfortable with matrices, vectors, basic set theory, functions, and
graphs will also help. There is no prerequisite for programming: we will learn
how to program with data from scratch!

## Grading Policies
20% midterm, 30% final exam, 20% homework, 10% quizzes, and  20% class project.

## Course Policies
There will be no makeup midterm nor final exam. No late homework will be
accepted. Grades of Incomplete will be granted only for dire medical or
personal emergencies that cause you to miss the final, and only if your work up
to that point has been satisfactory.

## Academic Honesty
I will be particularly unforgiving regarding academic dishonesty. Cheating
cases will result in an immediate failing grade for the class and will be
reported to the University Center for Student Conduct.  Please read the
following Honor Code carefully.
