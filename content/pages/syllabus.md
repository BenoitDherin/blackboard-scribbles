Slug: syllabus

The course will be organized around 5 concepts:

  *  Concept 1: Programming with data (structures in data and code, data munging)
  *  Concept 2: Computing with data (vectors, matrices, series, and dataframes)
  *  Concept 3: Visualizing data (pie chart, box plots, etc. and more artistic representations)
  *  Concept 4: Analyzing data (getting insight from data through statistical analysis and learning algorithms)
  *  Concept 5: Collaborating around data (through a team class project)

Here are the technologies and computing tools you will learn in this course:

  *  The Unix operating system for data processing : Shell programming, Bash, grep, sed, awk, regular expression
  *  The Python ecosystem for scientific computing : Python, iPython, NumPy, SciPy, Panda, and Matplotlib
  *  The R programming language for statistical analysis and visualization: R and R visual studio

If time permits, we will also explore:

  *  The D3 framework for rich data visualization: web programming, HTML, CGI, JavaScript, and D3
  *  The SQL query language for storing and accessing data from SQL databases: SQL, MySql, SQLite

This course has three main goals:

  *  Learning data mining technologies used by the industry in your neighborhood ;)
  *  Learning statistical analysis with R for your studies here at the stat department and beyond
  *  Getting experience in working collaboratively around data mining projects and creating a portfolio for future job hunt
